Natural language inference is the task of determining whether a “hypothesis” is true
(entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral) given a “premise”. Here, I
am going to use the subset of Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus containing
around 550k hypothesis/premise pairs.
The data is being uploaded to drive and being consumed by mounting google drive, this way of getting files can be modified as per coder interest
